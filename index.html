            Phumza is a 26 year old, she was born on the 29th of february 1996.
            Phumza has 2 simblings and she is the last born, she graduated 2020
            with Bsc degree in Animal Science but as time goes she fell out of
            love with her career. Since she had no interest with anything that
            had to do with Animal science, she heard about Tech industry that it
            is in demand so she had an interest in knowing more about everything
            that has to do with Tech industry. Until one day when she heard
            about programing languages and that there's a place called Codex
            that can prepare you for working industry. In codex you learn
            everything yourself there is no lecture that will stand infront of
            you and teach you. But in that journey there are mentors to assist
            you whenever you need assistance. Therefore I can call myself an
            agile web developer.

          <h2>A place she would like to visit</h2>
          <img class="col-6" src="./images/99173.jpg" alt="New York image" />
          <p class="justify">
            New York is the city that Phumza would love to visit mainly because,
            New York is not only the most famous city in the world but also,
            arguably, the best for tourists, thanks to its diverse culture and
            myriad of entertainment options. There’s never a dull day in the
            city that doesn’t sleep. New York City offers visitors endless
            possibilities, great diversity, and high energy. The city has always
            been the crème de la crème for first-rate dining, cultural activity,
            and unparalleled shopping. For tourists, it’s an amazing city and,
            at times, slightly intimidating which is why many visitors enjoy
            visiting by cruise ship. New York City is full of diverse
            neighborhoods and Bensonhurst is one under-the-radar community you
            need to seek out. Located in Brooklyn, Bensonhurst is incredibly
            multicultural, so much so that it’s the site of Brooklyn’s own
            Chinatown and Little Italy. Rising populations from Hong Kong, the
            Middle East and Mexico have only added to the mix. For shopping,
            dining and getting a less-touristy glimpse at NYC’s most prevalent
            cultures, Bensonhurst is worth the train ride.

          <h2 class="center">Foreign Language That she would like to learn</h2>
          <p class="center">
            French is the foreign language I would love to learn, because I want
            to be able to communicate with people there in Paris and also it is
            the most beautiful language in the world. French is known as a
            romance language and the second most useful language in the world
            for business.

            The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town is the oldest building in South
            Africa. The Dutch built it as a supply station and military fortress
            in the 1600s. Today the castle is the headquarters of the South
            African military in the Western Cape province. It also houses the
            Castle Military Museum and the William Fehr Art Collection. The
            castle is a part of a group of museums in Cape Town called the Iziko
            Museums. The Castle of Good Hope was declared a national monument in
            1936.The Castle of Good Hope is in the shape of a star with five
            points, called bastions. It was built like this so that soldiers
            could protect the walls in several directions. A bell tower was
            built at the main entrance to the castle. Its bell weighs more than
            660 pounds (300 kilograms). Used to warn people of danger, the bell
            could be heard more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) away.

          <p class="justify">
            Parliament is the legislative authority of South Africa and has the
            power to make laws for the country, in accordance with the
            Constitution. It consists of the National Assembly (NA) and the
            National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Parliamentary sittings are
            open to the public. The building consists of three main sections:
            the original building, completed in 1884, and additions constructed
            in the 1920s and 1980s. The National Council of Provinces, on the
            other hand, must ensure that provincial interests are taken into
            account in the national sphere of government. It does that by taking
            part in the law-making process and by being the forum where issues
            affecting the provinces are debated publicly.

          <p class="justify">
            Cape Town City Hall is one of our oldest and most central public
            spaces and home to the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra. Following a
            lengthy makeover, the heritage venue is available for a wide range
            of cultural and social events. The City Hall no longer houses the
            offices of the City of Cape Town, which are located in the Cape Town
            Civic Centre. From 1982 to 2008 it hosted the Central Library, which
            has since moved to the adjacent Old Drill Hall. The City Hall has
            become a central venue for creative and cultural events such as art
            exhibitions and concerts. One of these events includes the City Hall
            Sessions. Perhaps the most widely publicized event held at the Cape
            Town City Hall is the Festive Lights Switch On, hosted by the City
            of Cape Town. The event is free to all, and includes top local
            performers, musicians and a projection mapping display on the facade
            of the building.
